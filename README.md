# CSS Linter

## About
CSS Linter project at [Microverse]
This project is a CSS Linter that checks for various CSS errors such as multiple semicolumns, semicolons, a wrong indentation on code lines, and error in spacing while opening curly braces. I named the CSS Linter Alpha_Lint. It was built as a Ruby Capstone project at Microverse to show my efficiency in using OOP in ruby language and the ability to work with minimal supervision. Here is a screenshot of the working code displaying error it uncovered in a CSS code.
