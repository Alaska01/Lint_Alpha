# CSS Linter

## About
CSS Linter project at [Microverse]
This project is a CSS Linter that checks for various CSS errors such as multiple semicolumns, semicolons, a wrong indentation on code lines, and error in spacing while opening curly braces. I named the CSS Linter Alpha_Lint. It was built as a Ruby Capstone project at Microverse to show my efficiency in using OOP in ruby language and the ability to work with minimal supervision. Here is a screenshot of the working code displaying error it uncovered in a CSS code.

- The position a player is choosing should not have been taking
- The move made by a user should be a number otherwise its an invalid move
- A player can win by making three consecutive moves vertically, horizontally or diagonally
- If all position has been taken and there is no winner then its a tie(draw) For more detailed information on the game rules [CLICK HERE](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/tic-tac-toe-game-rules-412170)
