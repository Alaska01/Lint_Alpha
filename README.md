# CSS Linter

## About
CSS Linter project at [Microverse]
This project is a CSS Linter that checks for various CSS errors such as multiple semicolumns, semicolons, a wrong indentation on code lines, and error in spacing while opening curly braces. I named the CSS Linter Alpha_Lint. It was built as a Ruby Capstone project at Microverse to show my efficiency in using OOP in ruby language and the ability to work with minimal supervision. Here is a screenshot of the working code displaying error it uncovered in a CSS code.

# Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy on how to get your Alphat_Lint running on your local machine to debug CSS code errors. The gem colorize will also need to be installed to have a colored output. [Follow this link](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/colorize-ruby-terminal-output) on how to install the colorize gem.

## How To Run Checks üîß

- You may also want to watch the video for a graphical demonstration how to run the code and avoid some errors on windows machine. [Video Link Here](https://www.loom.com/share/7207996f411541858e7a26ef5efe2975)
